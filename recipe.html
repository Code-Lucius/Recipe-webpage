    <h2>Tips and Variations:</h2>
    <p>
      Tip 1: In the case where you have a very watery waterleaf, you might not
      have to add water. This commonly happens during the rainy seasons as
      leaves generally have more water during that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip 2: You might need to boil the stockfish a little. This is dependent on
      how soft/hard it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Variations: People always have different ways of doing things. This is my
      own way and I will definitely be open to learning other variations.
